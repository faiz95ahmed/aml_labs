    "Another possibility is to define a **black-box** probabilistic model, where its (latent or unobserved) random variables do not have physically salient meanings, but its inputs and outputs nonetheless describe meaningful things about the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this viewpoint, we could image a neural network as a probabilistic model, where it's **weights are latent random variables**, and its output is a random variable which depends on the weights and the inputs of the network. More precisely, defining some weights $w$, and input and output variables $x$ and $y$, the neural network is used to model $P(y | w, x)$.\n",

    "Where $f(w,x)$ is the output of the neural network. In theory, if we define a **prior** on the neural network weights $w$, we could use Pyro (or any PPL) in exactly the same way as we did in the previous part to infer the posterior distribution of the weights $P(w | \\mathcal{D})$, given some training data (observations) $\\mathcal{D}=\\{(x_1,y_1),...(x_n,y_n)\\}$.
