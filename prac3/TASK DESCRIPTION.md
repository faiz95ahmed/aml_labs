# Task description for Advanced Topics in Machine Learning: Practical 3


Below are the details for carrying out Practical 3 (Bayesian machine learning) of the Advanced Topics in Machine Learning 2021 course.

## Setting up your environment

The practical only requires Python libraries to run. We highly recommend setting up a conda environment, for example:

```
conda create -n workshop python=3
conda activate workshop
```

and then installing the following dependencies:

```
conda install matplotlib jupyter

conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio -c pytorch# installs pytorch

pip install pyro-ppl# installs pyro
```

## Practical overview

The practical is split up into three parts, detailed below:

**Part 1a: Introduction to Pyro**

**Part 1b: Bayesian neural networks with Pyro**

**Part 2: Basic VAE implementation in PyTorch**

**Part 3: Implementing autodiff from scratch**

We expect that you will be able to complete Part 1a and Part 1b within the practical: Parts 2 and 3 are optional extensions which we highly recommend if you have the time.

## Your tasks

Each task has an accompanying Jupyter notebook, which details the task and has empty cells which you must complete.

Please submit your completed Jupyter notebooks to the Practical 3 Assignment on Teams. You are only expected to submit notebooks for Part 1a and Part 1b; the other parts are entirely optional.

We only require .ipynb notebook files. Please do not upload large training datasets/ other files.

## Deadline for submission

The deadline for submitting your notebooks is **23:59 26th Feb 2021**.

## Your demonstrators

Your demonstrators are: Ben Moseley and David Augustin.

Please come and talk to us whenever you need help. We are available on Teams throughout the course.
